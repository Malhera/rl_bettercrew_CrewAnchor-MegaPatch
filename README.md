## Original mod over [there](https://github.com/rl-starbound/rl_bettercrew)

A fairly important patch for BetterCrew (either **[Full](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3031599475)** or [diet](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2892655130) version) to properly support modded races' techstations (S.A.I.L).

## The game won't start if you don't have **one** of the two versions of Better Crew installed
### **Don't install both the full and diet versions of better crew at once**

Currently added support for a selection of objects from the following mods:
- Kitsune Race
- Neki (and Neki Debloat's box)
- SCS Crafting Stations
- More Outpost Objects
- Avali Triage
- AvaliPlus
- Avali Additions&Aguments Revisited
- SteampunkCrafting!
- *more to come?*

Also adds NPCtoy/Anchor tags to a couple vanilla items. Can add more on request.

It doesn't yet add mod-specific crew jobs though (like the nekimechanic/nekiengineer etc). I still have to do that too :/

I'm prioritizing mods I use and/or get requested, but if some mod authors feel like support their creations themselves, that would be swell °^°
